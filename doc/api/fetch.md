The Fetch function can be used to make HTTP request and to read resources that are part of the application.

When a relative URL is given, Tabris.js will interpret it as a path relative to the application's main `package.json`. This allows you to read static resources, i.e. the files residing in your project folder and not excluded via [`.tabrisignore`](../build.md#the-tabrisignore-file). You can also use URLs relative to the current [module](../modules.md) by using the `__dirname` variable, e.g. `fetch(__dirname + "/foo.txt");`.

> :point_right: To enable access to SSL protected resources that use self signed certificates add them to [`app.trustedCertificates`](./app.md). Alternatively you can disable the `UseStrictSSL` preference in the config.xml to accept all certificates. See [Building a Tabris.js App](../build.md#preferences).
